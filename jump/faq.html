The majority of the Box2D demos seem to have a flat surface, or ground.
I ran across a series of forum postings that should by first creating a bezier curve, 

http://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/



var surfaceDef = new b2d.b2BodyDef();
    surfaceDef.type = b2d.b2Body.b2_staticBody;
    surfaceDef.userData = 'curved-surface';
            
var surfaceFixtureDef = new b2d.b2FixtureDef();
    surfaceFixtureDef.density = 1;
    surfaceFixtureDef.friction = 0.5;

var shape = new b2s.b2PolygonShape();

var x1, y1, x2, y2;
var ptArray = new Array();
var curvedSurface = world.CreateBody(surfaceDef);

var ptOnCurve = points[0];
x1 = this.p2m(ptOnCurve.x);
y1 = this.p2m(ptOnCurve.y);

for (var i = 1; i < points.length; i++) {
     var pt = points[i];
     x2 = this.p2m(pt.x);
     y2 = this.p2m(pt.y);
     
     var edgeShape = new b2s.b2PolygonShape();
         edgeShape.SetAsEdge(new b2m.b2Vec2(x1, y1), new b2m.b2Vec2(x2, y2));
     
     curvedSurface.CreateFixture2(edgeShape);
     x1 = x2;
     y1 = y2;
 }
 
 
 Taking it a step furthur. thats great for
